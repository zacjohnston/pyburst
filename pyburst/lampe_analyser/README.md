# kepler_analyser

Functions for using the `kepler-analyser` program created by Nathanael Lampe (https://github.com/natl/kepler-analyser).

Mostly for setting up files in the correct structure `kepler-analyser`, which has some overlap with the functionality of `pyburst`, namely, extracting burst properties from `Kepler` models.
